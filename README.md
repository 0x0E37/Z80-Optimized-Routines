This is a repository of routines for the Z80!
As of its inception, it will likely be created with the Z80 TI8x series of calculators in mind, but most routines should be general enough.

Got an idea for how to make this resource better? Please let me know!
Found an optimization? Please share!
Got a useful routine or variation of a routine not yet here? Please add it!

If you share a routine that you didn't write, credit the author as best as you can (unless the author doesn't want to be credited).

Thanks!
